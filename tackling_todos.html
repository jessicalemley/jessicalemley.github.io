    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>Though there are hundreds of task managers out in the market, most are geared towards either professional project management or are little more than digital checklists. The problem with these tools is that they don’t account for the fact that life is multifaceted. While they
        can help log billable time or track a backlog of items, they don’t do much to create a balanced schedule or establish a sustainable work pace.</p>
    <h2>Discover</h2>
    <p>I analyzed the the task management activities of 5 users aged 24-50 for a period of 4 weeks and
        discovered that in every case, they used a combination of paper lists and google calendars to
        manage their to-do’s. I gained a number of insights from my observations and created an affinity map to discover common themes and patterns.</p>
    <h3>Common Problems</h3>
    <h4>Keeping Track</h4>
    <p>Keeping lists in notebooks alongside other notes and information gets cluttered. The more that is
        added, the harder it is to sift through.</p>
    <h4>Lists vs Real Life</h4>
    <p>Lists and schedules don’t always account for each other. You can have an infinite number of to-do’s,
        but there are a finite number of hours in a day. Meetings, calls, personal commitments, etc.
        shrink those available hours. When users end the day or week with tasks undone, it can feel like a
        failure.</p>
    <h4>Lack of Balance</h4>
    <p>While it feels gratifying to cross off to-do’s, lists tend to grow indefinitely and as anyone who
        has ever tried to get to inbox zero knows, we tend to sacrifice life balance in the futile pursuit
        of getting everything “done.” This feeling is only exacerbated when our productivity is under
        scrutiny by supervisors.</p>

    <h2>Define</h2>
    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <p>Through my interviews, I found that the women struggled more with the pressure to “handle everything”
        in both their professional and personal lives, especially when they had families to care for. The
        men I spoke to
        tended to delegate their personal concerns to their significant others to manage. So, I focused my
        primary user persona on millennial working mothers who are still building their careers.</p>
    <h3>Defining the Focus</h3>
    <p>Based on the results of my research, it looked like my users needed some sort of personal assistant close at hand that would actively help them "keep-it-together." I decided a mobile app that could organize, prioritize, and schedule to-do’s would help bring sanity to their overloaded lives.</p>
    <h2>Ideate</h2>
    <p>Now it was time to come up with a way to solve the problem. In addition to my user behavior observations, I researched advice from time-management experts and life coaches regarding task-management best practices. Overall, their consistent guidance was to break goals down into small tasks with deadlines, sort by priority, schedule time to complete them, and celebrate wins.</p>
    <h3>Task Flow</h3>
    <p>I broke out a three step process that covered the areas of greatest frustration for my primary persona: planning to-do's, managing them, and executing on them.</p>

    <img src="images/todo_taskflow.png" class="img-fluid mb-4" alt="task flow">
    <p> Then I sketched a number of different ideas, some of which can be seen below. Through a process known as Design Studio, I worked with others to vote elements in and out until we had a refined concept.</p>
    <img src="images/todo_sketches.png" alt="crypto dashboard">
    <h4>Personal Time and Task Management Assistant Concept</h4>
    <p>The idea that seemed to solve both the practical and emotional challenges of the user was a mobile app that could allow users to quickly create and manage their to-do lists, then would automatically schedule time for tasks to be completed based on their calendar availability and the urgency of the task.</p>

    <h2>Prototype</h2>
    <p>I created a few quick prototypes using Invision to represent key interactions and map out the structure and flow of the application.</p>
    <p>Let’s imagine that we‘re planning a project for work. We've got daily tasks that still need to be completed and previously scheduled meetings. We also have a work day that starts at 9am and concludes at 5pm. I’ll use this example scenario to take you through the app prototype in more detail below.</p>
    <h4>On-boarding</h4>

    <img class="gif" src="images/case_todo_onboard2.gif" alt="todo app guided onboarding gif">
    <h4>Creating a Project</h4>
    <p>After on-boarding, you are taken to the lists page where all of your projects are displayed and color-coded for easy scanning. you can also see how many tasks are completed versus remaining on each list. A "+" button on the top right triggers the creation of a new list. The app then prompts you to title your list, and gives you the opportunity to add your first to-do and set an optional deadline. You then size the task based on how long you estimate it will take to complete once started. You can come back and add or subtract tasks at any time.</p>

    <img class="gif" src="images/case_todo_add_item.gif" alt="todo app add item">
    <p>Once tasks and lists are created, the app finds available time in your calendar based on your sizing and any deadlines you have set. Tasks are displayed in a scrolling schedule that includes existing events synched from your personal calendar account. As tasks are completed, they become faded on the schedule.</p>
    <h4>Completing a Task</h4>
    <p>When it's time to start a task, your phone will alert you. If the app is closed or the screen has gone to sleep, you can access the task screen through the alert. If you are in the schedule screen you can simply click on the task to enter the task screen. By clicking  "start task," you are taken to the task timer where you can start and pause the timer, or mark the task complete. When the task is marked complete, the app updates the task data on the list and schedule screens.</p>
