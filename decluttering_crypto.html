    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>My client was an android software developer and cryptocurrency trader who needed a way to passively monitor trading bot he was building. </p>
    <h2>Discover</h2>
    <p>We started by documenting his trading strategy, intended users (friends and family), challenges with existing solutions, and his goals for the bot and dashboard.</p>
    <img src="images/test_image.png" alt="crypto dashboard">
    <h2>Define</h2>
    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <p>Given that the solution was intended to be a privately held application, we had a small pool of user types to consider. We defined two personas, a primary and a secondary: Michael, an avid crypto user who obsessively watches a number of market indicators looking for buy/sell opportunities, and Susan, a non-crypto user who is looking for a "set-it-and-forget-it" way to diversify her retirement portfolio without a lot of work and worry.</p>
    <img src="images/test_image.png" alt="crypto dashboard">
    <h3>Defining the problem</h3>
    <p>From our research, it was clear that most of the existing products out there were targeted towards our first persona and that there was an opportunity to bring in more passive users with a simpler format. That being said, we knew we needed to design a solution for the client first as he would be the one using the bot and fine-tuning it before opening it up to friends and family, so we decided our dashboard would be optimized toward to the more avid user, while offering a more simplified experience option for our secondary persona.</p>
    <img src="images/test_image.png" alt="crypto dashboard">
    <h2>Ideate</h2>
    <p>Now it was time to come up with a way to solve the problem. During the Discovery phase we learned that most "newbie" crypto users found commonly available market dashboards, wallets, and exchanges overwhelming.</p>
