    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>My client was an android software developer and cryptocurrency trader who was building an automated trading bot
        that would manage an investment fund for himself and a small group of users. The goal was to find a way for fund
        members keep an eye on the bot's performance without revealing the formula it used to make decisions.</p>
    <h2>Discover</h2>
    <p>We started by documenting his intended users (friends, family, and coworkers), challenges with existing
        solutions, and his goals for the bot and dashboard.</p>
    <p>Given that the solution was intended to be a privately used application, we had a relatively small pool of user
        types to consider. Still, we put together some interview questions and discussed the idea of the bot with his
        intended customers to gauge interest, gather feedback, and test our initial hypotheses around the value prop.</p>
    <p>We also looked at competitors such as Tradeview, Coinbase, and traditional investment dashboards to learn how
        people used these tools and what their pain points were. Then we created an affinity diagram to discover common
        themes and patterns.<p>
    <h3>Common Insights</h3>

    <p>Avid crypto users :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anxiety over market volatility and its impact on personal wealth.</li>
        <li>Defiant optimism about the future of Bitcoin as a valuable commodity and tansactional medium.</li>
        <li>Fear of "missing out" on positive price swings.</li>
        <li>With a few notable exceptions, users had between $10,000 and $50,000 invested in cryptocurrency.</li>
        <li>Obsessively monitored exchange accounts and market data.</li>
        <li>Irritated with low, slow returns and high fees with existing fund managers.</li>
        <li>Don't have time or interest to learn all these trading strategies.</li>
        <li>Common buzzwords/phrases: "FUD" "HODL" "To the moon!" "Now's the time to buy..."</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Non-crypto users:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>General dismissive or distrustful feelings toward cryptocurrency (some eye rolls were recorded).</li>
        <li>Readily admitted they were not sure what it is or how it works.</li>
        <li>Concerns that it is a scam or a fad.</li>
        <li>Uncertain how secure it is.</li>
        <li>Turned off by complicated purchasing, trading, and analytics.</li>
        <li>Afraid of getting "hacked."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When it came to investments, both users prioritized the same primary concerns:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Am I making money?</li>
        <li>Is the return worth the cost?</li>
        <li>Does the return outweigh the risk?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the answer to all of these was "yes," they all felt their fears and anxieties would be alleviated.</p>

    <h2>Define</h2>
    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <p> From there we were able to come up with two personas:
        (Primary) an avid crypto user who regularly purchases Bitcoin and obsessively checks the market price throughout
        the day, and (Secondary) a non-crypto user who is looking for a "set-it-and-forget-it" way to grow their wealth
        without a lot of work and worry.</p>


    <img src="images/case_crypto_personas.jpg" alt="crypto user">
    <h3>Defining the problem</h3>
    <p>Our conversations with both types of users underscored the fact that they wanted to keep a close and constant
        eye on what their money was doing. Our interviews also confirmed that they wanted to grow their accounts quickly
        and be able to take advantage of sporadic market upticks.</p>

    <p>Based on the information we gathered, we decided that for our MVP we would focus on the primary persona and
        design a tool that would allow them to watch the bot's activities in real-time while also tracking their
        portfolio's performance metrics.</p>
    <h2>Ideate</h2>
    <p>Now it was time to come up with a way to solve the problem. One UX challenge we had was that the bot was going
        to be hardware based so that use of the algorithm would limited only to those who were given a bot box and
        access credentials.This pretty much eliminated the options of a mobile or web application. Fortunately, we
        learned during the Discovery phase that most of our primary crypto users monitored the markets throughout the
        day by keeping an exchange tab open on a computer or TV monitor, so we decided to design an interface that was
        optimized this type of viewing.</p>
    <p>We started by sketching a number of different ideas, some of which can be seen below, and iterated on the designs
        until we had a refined concept that we felt best accomplished our users' goals.</p>
    <img src="images/case_crypto_sketch.jpg" alt="dashboard sketch">
    <h3>Super Simple Dashboards</h3>
    <p>The idea we were most happy with was a two-page TV dashboard that gave users a real-time overview of their bot's
        performance and also allowed them to monitor and compare their portfolio's performance over time. We wanted to
        give our user's the ability to see how their funds are doing at-a-glance, so we stuck to high-level KPI's and
        removed the clutter of typical exchanges and wallet dashboards.</p>
    <p>I built on this idea and created more detailed wireframes of the interface to validate the usability of the
        layout, then used those structures to create high-fidelity mock ups.</p>

    <h2>Prototype</h2>
    <h3>Splash Screen</h3>

    <img src="images/case_crypto_splash.jpg" alt="crypto splash screen">
    <h3>Real-Time Dashboard</h3>
    <p>When the app loads, users are taken to the Real-Time dashboard where they can view their bot's activity overlayed
        on a market chart. Visual indicators show when the bot buys, sells, and holds Bitcoin. They can also quickly
        see their portfolio's collective value and growth in USD, view their bot's performance over a one week rolling
        period. Finally, users can watch the bot's real-time holdings and active orders complete with profit/loss
        calculations.

    <img src="images/case_crypto_realtime.jpg" alt="crypto real-time dashboard">

    <h3>Portfolio Dashboard</h3>
    <p>On the portfolio screen, the dashboard charts the user's bot performance against the what they would have made
        using the "HODL" (buy and hold) strategy. They can also see periods of drawdown; when the bot traded for a loss.</p>
<h4>
    "Am I Making Money?"
</h4>
    <p>In discovery, we learned that typical market analysis platforms display performance metrics in a strategy performance report. To help our users better evaluate the bot's performance, we included five key performance metrics on the dashboard:
        <ol>
    <li>Total Net Profit</li>
    <li>Profit Factor</li>
    <li>Percent Profitable</li>
    <li>Average Trade Net Profit</li>
    <li>Maximum Drawdown</li>
</ol>

    <p>Many of our users cashed out their Bitcoin to pay for living expenses or large purchases. Since this impacts
        their overall portfolio value and illustrates how the bot is supplementing their income, we included a payout
        tracker.</p>

        <p>portfolio KPIs over rolling day, week, month, year, and all-time (since activation) views. View trading fees and fund expense ratios.
        View payouts received (funds withdrawn from portfolio as income).</p>
